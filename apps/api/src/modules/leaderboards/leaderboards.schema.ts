/**
 * Leaderboards — Zod schemas for the public top-N-by-ELO endpoint. The
 * surface is intentionally minimal so the iOS "Top Players" screen can
 * render a stable list with rank, ELO, and a quick win-rate glance.
 *
 * - `sport` is the sport slug ("padel", "tennis", ...). Required.
 * - `limit` caps the page size; the server enforces a hard 200 ceiling so
 *   a misbehaving client can't pull the entire ladder in one request.
 * - `offset` is the classic SQL offset for pagination — fine here because
 *   the underlying ranking is deterministic (ELO DESC, games_played DESC)
 *   and the data churns slowly compared to a feed timeline.
 * - `region` filters to players with confirmed games at matching venue
 *   names/addresses.
 *
 * Wave-9 additions — retention-focused filters surfaced on the iOS
 * Leaderboards screen so the player can carve the ladder by where they
 * play, who they want to compare against, and how recent the games are:
 *
 * - `scope` — `"city"` or `"global"`. `"city"` filters to players whose
 *   home coordinates are within the local radius of the signed-in viewer
 *   when the viewer has home coordinates. Anonymous callers or viewers
 *   without home coordinates gracefully fall back to global.
 * - `skill` — `"beginner"|"intermediate"|"advanced"|"expert"|"all"`.
 *   Maps to ELO ranges identical to `skillLevelFromElo`. `"all"` skips
 *   the filter entirely (the default behavior).
 * - `period` — `"week"|"month"|"all"`. Filters `player_sport_stats` by
 *   the recency window. We approximate this via `pss.updated_at` since
 *   `player_sport_stats` is updated on every confirmed game; precise
 *   week-bucketing would require joining `game_participants` which is
 *   heavier than we want for a top-N read.
